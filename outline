rule - American(x) ^ Weapon(y) ^ Nation(z) ^ Hastile(z) ^ Sells(x,z,y) -> Criminal(x)
atom/fact - American(West)

whenever a fact comes in unify it with one of the variables in a rule (American(West)/American(x))
if all the atoms in a rule are facts add the implication to the list of facts

for each line in file
	if line contains '->'
		line is a rule
		split line on the ' ^ ' and ' -> '
			put each atom/implication into a dictionary
				{American(x): False, Weapon(y): False, Nation(z): False, Hostile(z): False, Sells(x,z,y): False, Criminal(x): False}
			put dictionary into a list of dictionaries

	else if line contains 'PROVE'
		remove 'PROVE ' from line
		put remaining string into prove variable

	else
		put line into list of facts
		if line = prove
			proved = True
		else
			unify this fact's constant w/ any possible variables in the rules
				fact = American(West)
				substitution = {x/West}
				set rules[American(x)] = True
				if all the rules except for the last one in the dictionary are true
					rules[-1] = True

					replace variable in the rule w/ it's constant substitution

					add new fact to list of facts

			set the value in the dictionary of rules to true if this fact is equal to that rule
